                <p>Here, every mantra, reflection, and story is an offering at His feet. Each path shared, each sādhana offered, is not a destination—but a doorway. A step not to attain, but to dissolve. Not for knowledge, but for awareness. Not for becoming more—but for becoming empty of self.</p>
                <p>If you've found your way here, know that it is by His grace alone. Even this moment of recognition is His blessing—a silent call, a step closer to the formless, ever-present truth of Bhairava.</p>
